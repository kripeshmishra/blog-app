# My Memorable Journey to Jibhi, Himachal Pradesh üèûÔ∏è

## Introduction

Accompanied by my elder brothers, I embarked on an adventure to Jibhi in a Skoda Kushaq from Chandigarh. The scorching heat of Chandigarh greeted us initially, but as we approached Solan, the refreshing cold air rejuvenated our spirits. Our route took us through Shimla, and despite encountering road closures due to rain, we persevered, traveling nearly 80 kilometers along a single-lane road flanked by the Satluj River, finally arriving in Rampur Bushahr by evening. Our journey was remarkable, marked by unexpected detours and scenic vistas.

## A Warm Welcome in Rampur Bushahr

Upon reaching Rampur Bushahr, we were warmly welcomed as we attended a marriage ceremony. The hospitality extended to us further fueled our excitement for the adventures that lay ahead.

## Night Drive to Jibhi

Continuing our journey from Aanni, we embarked on a night drive towards Jibhi. The journey was enchanting, punctuated by intermittent stops to admire the majestic mountains under the starlit sky. Arriving in Jibhi, we made an online hotel reservation, bracing ourselves for the freezing cold that enveloped the area. After indulging in some apple cider to ward off the chill, we relished a hearty dinner before retiring for the night.

## A Serene Morning in Jibhi

Waking up to a breathtaking view of towering mountains cloaked in silence and lush greenery was a sight to behold. It was undeniably one of the most beautiful scenes I had ever witnessed. Immersing ourselves in the tranquil ambiance, we savored the serenity of the moment before beginning our day.
